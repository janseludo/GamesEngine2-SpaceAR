# Games Engine 2
##### Description of the assignment:
Created in unity, a mobile augmented reality spcaships that implemets Steering Behaviours from learned Games Engine 2

##### Instructions:
Upon forking the Spaceship AR from git hub:
* Make sure the build paltform is switched to android.
* Next is the windows/package manager - AR Foundation, AR subsystems and ARKit xr Plugin is updated.
* Enable USB debugging on your android phone

##### How it works:
Once the APK is sintalled on the android phone allow permission to the camera to start the spaceships to appear.

##### What I am most proud of in the assignment:
Is just the start of my exploration of augmented reiality. projecting spaceships will allow me to explore how to interact with objects in augmented reality. steering behaviours learned from Bryan Duggan's games engine 2 allows the spachips seek, arrive, pursue, evade and follow path in a much more realistic way.
